# Excel VBA Scripting

There is a screenshot for each year of results used in the Multi Year Stock Data file (2014-2016).

In addition, there are 3 VBA Script files:

    1. Ticker Summary Single Sheet - This VBA code contains a macro that will summarize the Tickers and provide the following information on a single worksheet within the workbook:
            a. Yearly Change
            b. Percent Change
            c. Total Stock Volume
            
            Note: You can easily find those with positive yearly changes in Green and those with negative yearly changes in red.
            
            The process takes less than 30 seconds to run and you should receive a Message Box indicating it has been completed.
            
    2. Ticker Summary Multiple Sheets - This VBA code contains a macro that will summarize the Tickers and provide the same information above for all the worksheets within the workbook at once.
    
            The process takes less than 30 seconds to run and you should receive a Message Box indicating it has been completed.
            
    3. Ticker Summary Bonus Script - This VBA code contains the same macro that runs on multiple sheets and an extra summary table to provide the following:
    
            a. Greatest % Increase
            b. Greatest % Decrease
            c. Greatest Total Volume
            
            The process takes less than 30 seconds to run and you should receive a Message Box indicating it has been completed.
